<p> &#160;&#160; &ensp; &ensp;&emsp; <a id="Molly"></a> Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now.
    On her desk, luing between the copies  of<i> Nature.</i> <i> New scientist</i>, and all 
    the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was
    a well thumbed copy of <cite> On the Road. </cite> It had been Molly's favorite
    book since college, and the longer she spend in these four walls the more
    she felt she needed to be free. </p>

    wilde quote proclaming that <q> Work is the refuge of people who have nothing 
    better to do.</q> Althought many considered her pioneering workm unraveling the secrets of
    the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>,to be an outstanding achievement,
     Molly<em>did</em> think she had something better to do. </figure>  </p>
